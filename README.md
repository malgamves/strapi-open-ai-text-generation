## <a id="installation"></a>ðŸ”§ Installation

Inside your Strapi Application, add the package

With `npm`

```bash
npm install ai-text-generation
```

or `yarn`

```bash
yarn add ai-text-generation
```


Then get your Open AI API Token [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add it to the `.env` file at the root of your project as `OPEN_AI_API_TOKEN`. Next, in `./config`, create a file called `plugins.js` to enable the plugin. 

```javascript
// ...
    'ai-text-generation': {
      enabled: true,
      config: {
        apiToken: process.env.OPEN_AI_API_TOKEN,
      },
    },
//...
```


After, build your admin with

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

and start your server with

```bash
npm run develop
```

or

```bash
yarn develop
```

and now you have the power of Open AI, right in your favourite CMS.

## <a id="contributing"></a>ðŸ›  Contributing

In this section, we'll look at how YOU can contribute to this Custom Field.

### Setting up the environment

Start by creating a new Strapi project.

```bash
npx create-strapi-app --quickstart strapi-plugin-dev
cd strapi-plugin-dev
```

Create a new plugins folder if it doesn't exist already.
```bash
mkdir -p src/plugins
```

Now we should clone this repository so you can work on it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malgamves/strapi-open-ai-text-generation.git src/plugins/ai-text-generation
```

Install project dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Now we need to register plugin so strapi can use it. In order to do that we need to create (if not already created) `./config/plugins.js` file and add entry to it.

```javascript
// ...
    'ai-text-generation': {
      enabled: true,
      config: {
        apiToken: process.env.OPEN_AI_API_TOKEN,
      },
      resolve: './src/plugins/ai-text-generation'
    },
// ...
```

> When contributing, you need to change the value of the `fetch()` url below https://github.com/malgamves/strapi-open-ai-text-generation/blob/78e692b214fc51f8de6bbf6a76fca4db767411eb/admin/src/components/Input/index.js#L25 to `http://localhost:1337`

Rebuild the project and start the server

```bash
yarn build
yarn develop
```

For an optimum development experience, start your Strapi server in `Watch Mode` so you don't have to build everytime you make changes as show below
```bash
yarn develop --watch-admin
```
